# Requirements
## Introduction
Calculators are simply a tool, which helps students to solve problems. Since they eliminate tedious computations and algebraic manipulations that discourage many students, calculators allow more students to solve problems and appreciate the power and value of mathematics in the world today.

## Research
Calculators also have the ability to store numbers into computer memory. Basic calculators usually store only one number at a time; more specific types are able to store many numbers represented in variables. The variables can also be used for constructing formulas. Some models have the ability to extend memory capacity to store more numbers; the extended memory address is termed an array index.

## Defining Our System
 In this the calculator has 9 operators :
`1.Addition
 2.Subtraction
 3.Multiply
 4.Division 
 5.Squareroot 
 6.Factorial 
 7.Exponent
 8.Logarithm 
 9.Power`

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:

 It can be used by any age group to do math operations more easily.

## What:

Its most common use is for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division along with few other mathematical operations.

## When:

Whenever there is use of any calculations we use it.

## Where:

It can be used anywhere to do calculations.

## How:

By using the calculator and by entering the appropriate number and getting the desired value.
